        <h2>CSS Zen Garden Design List #175</h2>
        <p>This is the design which i pretty like its layout. when i open this page i feel the layout is very clear, and the letter is very easy to read. the font size is 13px that is not a very big size, but large enough for me to see and read it clearly and comfortably. I also like the fonts that the designer use for the h1 and h2 are Trebuchet MS and Lucida Sans.
        </p>.
        
        
        <h2>CSS Zen Garden Design List #41</h2>
        <p>This website's font size that is only 0.7em/1.2em is too much small for readers to read it, and the color of the font has very less contract with the background color that is also caused a prolems for readers to see the contents. Who do want to read a webpage's content that make their eyes hurt? Maybe others don't even want to read after open this link.
